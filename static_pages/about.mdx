Hey, I am **Jatin Sharma**. A **Front-end Developer/React Developer** from India who loves to design and code. I use **React.js** or **Next.js** to build the web application interfaces and the functionalities. At the moment, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**.

My interest in computers started at a very young age, and I was very eager to learn as much as I could about them. I remember my **first website** that I made years ago, which had a **terrible interface** and design. The purpose of it was to download movies and stuff like that. It is unfortunate that I don't have the code. 

From then I **started** to learn about **web development** through many video tutorials, documentations and articles. The first programming language I learned was **C**. Since then, I have also learned **Python**. I also played around with **databases**, but **Firebase** is my favorite right now.


Aside from coding, I write about web development stuff on my **<u>[blog](https://j471n/blogs)</u>** as well. I don't have the time or really any interest in playing video games these days. However, I also enjoy watching some Sci-Fi movies and web series whenever I have the chance. 

If you were to ask me what stack I would prefer, I would say 

ðŸ‘‰ Framework - **Next.js**

ðŸ‘‰ Database : **Firebase**

ðŸ‘‰ CSS - **TailwindCSS** 

You can do anything you can think of with these three things. Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React-based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.


I love my work and enjoy each and every project as I get it. Feel free to look at my portfolio and don't hesitate to contact me.
